Name of the Project: pos-terminal-jtbn

Overview of the project: This website will allow employees of a business named "Hip Hop, Pizza, and Wangs" to create, view, edit, and delete orders, placed by phone or in-person, of customers visiting their restaurant. Once the authenticated user (the employee) logs-into their system, they will be able to view all orders placed in their system. They will then be able to create a new order for the patron. Once the order has been created, they can add, edit, and delete items from that order. When all items have been finalized, the employee can then be taken to a page that notes that payment has been provided and can then close the order. Lastly, employees can view a Revenue page showing a list of orders filtered by different criteria (date range, order type, payment type, and tip amount).
